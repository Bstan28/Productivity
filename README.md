# Productivity
Various scripts that help boost efficiency and productivity.

# Reminder-Text-Notification.py
Script helps persistently remind you about a task that you want to accomplish. I use this script to remind me to do something every hour on the hour Monday through Friday from 8am to 4pm. This could be modified to what ever you need to be reminded about. Whether it's to drink more water, strech your legs or do a quick set of pushups.
